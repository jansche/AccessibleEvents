## Live and on-demand captioning [#4](http://github.com/jansche/AccessibleEvents/issues/4)
#### WHAT 
To make content more accessible to those with language barriers, hearing disabilities or any factors that affect understanding of content through listening
#### BENEFICIARIES
Viewers who are not native speakers of the event's primary language
#### TODO
Prioritize investment for a human captioner and/or prioritize platforms that allow for live captioning,
#### TOOLS
A human captioner is best, but if you are short on budget there are other options. Microsoft Teams has the best live captioning, with options to live translate to up to 6 languages. Zoom, YouTube and Microsoft Stream allow for automatic transcription of recordings which can be help for on-demand.
#### RESPONSIBILITIES
Event organizer

#### Reportedly happened here
Microsoft Tech Community APAC Online was my example, we took the additional step to correct the automatic transcriptions for accuracy and upload as on-demand videos. We were working with a diverse audience, across multiple languages and hence, saw a strong need for captioning to be provided
